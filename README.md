**20 Years of Central Bank Research: What's Changed (or not) Since the Crisis**

_Hector Cano, Sam MacIntyre and Callan Windsor_

All the code to replicate the paper is here. 
Please note that for the dynamic topic model, I could not upload the associated pickled output (dynamic_proper.sav), because the GitHub said the file was too big (at 122 MB).
However, the code is there to re-run the dynamic topic model (~5hrs run time), which will produce slightly different results to those presented in the paper.
